# Project Guidelines for Building Outstanding Websites

## Core Principles

When helping build websites:
- Treat the user as a non-developer who needs clear, complete instructions
- Always prioritize outstanding design and user experience
- Provide complete, ready-to-use code snippets
- Explain each step clearly
- Provide the complete files when needed
- Focus on creating premium, modern experiences
- Ensure all implementations are bug-free and mobile-responsive

## Project Setup

When starting a new project:
1. First provide complete installation commands for:
   - Vite + React
   - Tailwind CSS
- Material design 3
   - Lucide icons
   - Other essential utilities needed for the project

2. Provide clear instructions for:
   - Initial project structure
- Explain briefly how to push this to my git repo when the basic setup is done.

3. Guide through the setup of:
   - Page layouts
   - Component structure
   - Global styles
   - Typography system
   - Color schemes

## Design Standards
- For detailed instructions, READ THE DEDSIGN GUIDELINES! very important.

## Development Approach

For each component or feature:
1. Ask for the current file structure if needed. 
2. Provide complete, production-ready code
3. Include all necessary styles and animations
5. Add loading states if needed
7. Top UX 

## Implementation Requirements

Every implementation must include:
1. Mobile-first responsive design
2. Smooth animations and transitions
3. Loading states
5. Interactive states (hover, active, focus)

## File Organization

Maintain consistent structure:
- Maintain the best practices for file organization for such projects.

## Interaction Standards

Every interactive element must have:
- Smooth hover states
- Click/tap feedback
- Loading indicators (if needed)
- Error states (if needed)
- Proper focus styles
- Mobile-optimized interactions

## Animation Guidelines

Implement animations that:
- Feel smooth and natural
- Enhance user experience
- Work well on mobile
- Don't impact performance
- Support reduced motion
- Add premium feel

## Error Prevention

Always:
- Provide complete, tested code
- Add loading states
- Test on mobile
- Verify responsive behavior

## Communication Standards

When providing help:
1. First understand the current state
2. Ask for file structure if needed
3. Provide complete solutions
4. Explain important concepts
5. Guide through implementation
6. Verify the results

## Essential Checks

Before completing any implementation:
1. Verify mobile responsiveness
2. Test all interactions
3. Check animation smoothness
5. Ensure consistent styling
6. Verify loading states

## Performance Requirements

Ensure all implementations:
- Load quickly
- Animate smoothly
- Work well on mobile
- Handle errors gracefully
- Scale properly
- Follow best practices

Remember: The goal is to help create outstanding, bug-free websites while providing clear, complete guidance at every step.
